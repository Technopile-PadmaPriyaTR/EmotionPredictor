Facial expressions are a form of nonverbal communication. Face emotion recognition is the process of detecting emotions from facial expressions. Without emotions, relational communication cannot be done among people. Use of technology to help people with emotion recognition is a relatively nascent research area. Various studies have been done for the classification of these facial expressions. There is strong evidence for the universal facial expressions of seven emotions which include: neutral happy, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, and surprise. So it is very important to detect these emotions on the face. The model should be able to real-time identify the emotions. Here I've used Microsoft Azure Face API for the recognition of faces. This will return the emotion of the person on the given photo. At last, Azure Apps service is used to host the created website.
